# Detection of the Parkinson’s Disease

### Parkinson’s Disease:
   Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

### We Will Use XGBoost:  
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.


## About Dataset:
[LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipayanbiswas/parkinsons-disease-speech-signal-features)
- The data used in this study were gathered from 188 patients with PD (107 men and 81 women) with ages ranging from 33 to 87 (65.1Â±10.9) at the Department of Neurology in CerrahpaÅŸa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. The control group consists of 64 healthy individuals (23 men and 41 women) with ages varying between 41 and 82 (61.1Â±8.9). During the data collection process, the microphone is set to 44.1 KHz and following the physicianâ€™s examination, the sustained phonation of the vowel /a/ was collected from each subject with three repetitions.

## Prerequisites:
You’ll need to install the following libraries with pip:

!pip install numpy pandas sklearn xgboost

You’ll also need to install Jupyter Lab, and then use the command prompt to run it:

C:\Users\DataFlair>jupyter lab


## Libraries Used

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


## Conclusion
In this Python machine learning project, we learned to detect the presence of Parkinson’s Disease in individuals using various factors. We used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. This gives us an accuracy of **86.18%**, which is great considering the number of lines of code in this python project.
